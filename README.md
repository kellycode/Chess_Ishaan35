 The chess engine uses the minimax algorithm to decide on the best move to make. The minimax algorithm examines a large tree of possible moves that can be played by the computer and the opponent (human player) depending on how far ahead into the game the algorithm looks. The number of moves the algorithm looks into the future refers to the depth of the algorithm. The greater the depth, the better the algorithm plays. There is also a separate section related to global chess stats from chess.com which are obtained from an API in JSON format using XMLHttpRequests. The stats feature the top 50 players in  the world on chess.com separated by different game modes such as rapid and bullet chess. This website is responsive and can be viewed on computers and mobile devices.
